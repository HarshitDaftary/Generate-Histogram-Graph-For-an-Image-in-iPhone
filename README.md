Generate Histogram Graph of An Image in iPhone

Hi I have created this repository with a view to help iOS developers to generate Histogram from Image.

You need to change the viewDidLoad method to change image.

This code is working fine , it shows the Histogram in similar way to the PREVIEW app in Mac.

Currently I am facing just one problem that the graph is not so sharp as it is in PREVIEW for the same image, you may check it out

In case any query , you may mention me @daftaryharshit on twitter.com

Thanks,
Regards,
